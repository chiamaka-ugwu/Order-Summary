## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
I am trying to get comfortable with using the "rem" standard of measurement in place of pixels. I'm still very much used to pixels but I hope to improve on others, for accessibility sake.

### Useful resources

- [PX to REM Concerter](http://www.standardista.com/px-to-rem-conversion) - This helped me to convert values in pixels to rem.
